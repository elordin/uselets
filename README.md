# Uselets

Uselets are a high-level abstraction of communicating components for Web-Applications.

It is loosely based on [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), [Reacts Flux Architecture](http://facebook.github.io/flux/) and [Formlets](http://links-lang.org/formlets/).


As this is very much under rapid development, this repository contains multiple iterations and variants.

Primary focus in on the [Links](http://links-lang.org) implementation in the `/links` directory.
